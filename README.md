# Rimworld-Mod: Call-A-Trader

This mod enables your pawns to request an orbital trader from the 'Orbital Traders Hub'.

* Adds the option call an orbital trader using the commons console.
* Adds an incident event where you can choose if you want to receive an orbital trader in the near future.
* Costs, Delay and Cooldown for the call-action are configurable.


This mod was inspired by KiameV's "Call Trade Ships" mod which can be found here: https://github.com/KiameV/rimworld-calltradeships
